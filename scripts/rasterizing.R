# opening farm size data

# spatializing the results

# here there are two options. You can either just rasterize the municipalities, like I did, or you can transform Brazil in a grid of points with the same resol. of mapbiomas for instance, extract the proportion value in each point and then convert it to raster. And then calculate the values at the 10km grid.


# municipalities boundaries for 2020

mun <- geobr::read_municipality(year = "2020")

names(farm_sizes_bin)[1] <- "code_muni"

# add proportion of the area of the mun covered by large farms
mun <- left_join(mun,farm_sizes_bin[farm_sizes_bin$farm_sizes_bin=='>=1000ha',])


# transform in raster (using municipality boundary)

#  use some actual raster to get the projection and resol. right (below I did res 1 degree)

r <- raster(mun, res = 1)

mun_r <- fasterize(mun, r, field = "prop_area_bin", fun="first")

# check output

plot(mun_r)
